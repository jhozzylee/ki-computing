            reliable, secure, and stress-free for small businesses. Over the years, he’s
            seen firsthand how technology can either empower a business to grow or hold it
            back. That perspective shaped his belief that IT should be more than just
            fixing problems — it should be about creating confidence, stability, and
            long-term value.
